# Encoder-Decoder-Paper
The COMPASS StateSpace toolbox contains functions for builiding a model to estimate a hidden state from behavior such as reaction time.
The Decoder_Encoder_Model contains codes for building a neural encoder-decoder framework using behavior decoded hidden state and neural features.
Start with Main_encoder_model_fit.m for fitting a neural encoder model
The inout file must contain a matrix of neural features and the behavior decoder model.
